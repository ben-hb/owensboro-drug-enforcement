Visualizing enforcement of marijuana-related crimes in Owensboro KY using traffic stop data from the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/).   

Despite the recent wave of legalization bills passed by state legislatures, Kentucky continues to criminalize the possession, usage, and distribution of both medical and recreational marijuana. This graphic aims to communicate what the enforcement of marijuana-related crimes looks like in an sample city in Kentucky, with particular emphasis on the role of gender in enforcement. 

Data is sourced directly from the Stanford Open Policing Project's website to allow for real-time updating as Stanford updates their database. The code is designed to be easily adaptable to create a similar visualization for any other city in the Standford database that provides in-depth data on reason for stop.
